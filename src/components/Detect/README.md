## How It Works

### 1. **Start Detection**
- Click "Start" to begin webcam detection
- Perform sign language gestures in front of the camera
- Each detected sign appears in the "Current Gesture" section

### 2. **Build Sentences**
- Signs are automatically added to the current sentence
- Words are properly spaced for natural reading
- Watch the sentence build in real-time
- Status shows "Building..." while actively detecting

### 3. **Complete Sentences**
- **Auto-complete**: Wait 3 seconds after last gesture
- **Manual complete**: Click "Complete Sentence" button
- **Manual clear**: Click "Clear Sentence" to start over

### 4. **Speech Output**
- **Individual signs**: Click "Speak Gesture" to hear the current sign
- **Full sentences**: Click "Speak Sentence" to hear the complete sentence
- **History playback**: Click "Speak" on any saved sentence

### 5. **Customize Speech**
- Adjust speech rate (0.5x to 1.5x)
- Adjust pitch (0.5x to 2x)
- Settings apply to all speech output

## Use Cases
